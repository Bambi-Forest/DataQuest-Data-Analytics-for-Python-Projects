[Project 1] Guided Project:Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
- This project is where I analyze two large data sets, Google Play and Apple store apps to find the most profitable free genre app that would bring in revenue due to in-app ads that users would most likely visit. I'm cleaning the data to remove rows with missing data, duplicate rows, remove non-English apps, and then analyze how popular certain apps are. I had to analyze the data to make sure certain apps in each category do not have biased apps by having several apps having the majority of installs or user ratings. These results will enable me to recommend an app that will gain enough attention from the users to produce enough revenue for the companies.
