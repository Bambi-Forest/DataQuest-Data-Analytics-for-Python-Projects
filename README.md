[Project 1] Guided Project:Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This project is where I:

â€¢  Analyze two large data sets: Google Play and Apple store apps.
- Find the most profitable free genre app that would bring in revenue due to in-app ads that users would most likely visit. 
- Find out how popular certain apps are.
- Make sure certain apps in each category do not have biased apps (done based on majority of installs or user rating).
- Results will enable me to recommend an app that will gain enough attention to produce enough revenue for the companies!

Cleaning the data Process:

Removing rows due to:
- Missing data
- Duplicate rows
- Non-English apps
- Non Free Apps
