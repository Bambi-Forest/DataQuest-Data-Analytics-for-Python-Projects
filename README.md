Hello, This is my Data Analytics journey for the Data Analytics for Python Career Track using DataQuest.io.
- All 17 Projects will be stored here :)

[Project 1] Guided Project:Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

[Clink Here to view Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets Project](https://github.com/Bambi-Forest/DataQuest-Data-Analytics-for-Python-Projects/blob/main/Guided%20Project--%20Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)

This project is where I:

•  Analyze two large data sets: Google Play and Apple store apps.
- Find the most profitable free genre app that would bring in revenue due to in-app ads that users would most likely visit. 
- Find out how popular certain apps are.
- Make sure certain apps in each category do not have biased apps (done based on majority of installs or user rating).
- Results will enable me to recommend an app that will gain enough attention to produce enough revenue for the companies!

Cleaning the data Process:

Removing rows due to:
- Missing data
- Duplicate rows
- Non-English apps
- Non Free Apps

[Project 2] Guided Project- Exploring Hacker News Posts

[Clink Here to view Exploring Hacker News Posts Project](https://github.com/Bambi-Forest/DataQuest-Data-Analytics-for-Python-Projects/blob/main/Guided%20Project-%20Exploring%20Hacker%20News%20Posts.ipynb)
This project is where I:

• Analyze the Hacker News with about 300,000 rows.
- We're particularly interested in titles that begin with Ask HN and Show HN.
- Ask HN - User submits posts related to asking the Hacker News community a specific question.
- Show HN -Users sumbit posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Cleaning the data Process:

Removing rows due to:
- Missing data
- Remove rows that has comments that are 0
- Remove rows that do not pertain to ASK HN or Show HN posts

Concepts used:
- Reformatted and cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis
- Dates and times
- Object-oriented programming
- Working with Strings
